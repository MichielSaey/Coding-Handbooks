## Break
The break statement in Python terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement.
End loop

## Pass

The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.

## Continue

The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.
