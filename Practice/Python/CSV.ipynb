    "CSV stands for comma-separated values. A CSV file allows you to store your data in a tabular format. In fact, it is a simple text file with numerous lines. Each line of the file is a data entry. Each line contains elements separated by commas. The CSV data can be easily exported to other spreadsheets or databases.\n",

    "As you can guess, the idea of writing to a CSV file doesn't differ from the idea of writing something to any text file. Imagine your colleague brought you a new report in which you saw a crime that isn't stored in your CSV file. So, you decided to append it to the end of the file. What do you do? You create a list in which you write down all the necessary information about the crime, then you join the elements of the list with a comma, write the data into the file. Finally, you need to close the file.\n",
